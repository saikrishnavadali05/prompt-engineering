# Introduction to Prompt Engineering

Prompt engineering is the art and science of designing effective prompts that guide language models like GPT-4 to produce the most accurate, relevant, and useful responses.

## 🌟 Why Prompt Engineering Matters

Language models are powerful — but only when you communicate with them correctly. A good prompt:

- Makes your task easier
- Saves time and tokens
- Improves model accuracy
- Reduces hallucinations and errors

---

## 💬 Example

```mdx-code-block
prompt="Summarize the causes of World War I in 3 bullet points."
```

🟢 Output:
- Alliance system in Europe created tension  
- Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand triggered war  
- Imperialism and arms race escalated conflict

## 🎯 What Makes a Good Prompt?

:::tip Prompting Tips
A well-crafted prompt should be:
- **Clear** – Avoid vague language
- **Specific** – Include context and structure
- **Actionable** – Use explicit instructions or formatting
:::

| Prompt Type      | Example |
|------------------|---------|
| Zero-shot        | `Translate to French: How are you?` |
| Few-shot         | `Q: Capital of France? A: Paris\nQ: Capital of Germany? A:` |
| Instructional    | `Write a Python function to reverse a string.` |
| Chain-of-Thought | `Let's think step by step: 45 is 5 less than 50...` |

## 📊 Common Prompt Errors

```diff
- Tell me about AI.
+ Summarize the role of artificial intelligence in modern education in 100 words.
```

Avoid:
- Being too broad or vague
- Forgetting to set format/length expectations
- Ignoring the model’s limitations

## 📁 Real-World Applications

| Domain         | Prompt Example |
|----------------|----------------|
| 🎓 Education   | `Explain Newton's 3 laws for a 10-year-old.` |
| 💻 Programming | `Fix this Python bug: ...` |
| 📈 Business     | `Write a LinkedIn post announcing our new product.` |
| 🧠 Research     | `Summarize this abstract in plain language.` |

## 🧠 How LLMs Understand Prompts

Language models work via **next-token prediction**.

```txt
You say: "Explain why the sky is blue."
The model guesses the next word one-by-one:
→ "The", "sky", "is", "blue", "because", ...
```

The **order and structure of your prompt** guide the model's path of prediction.

## 🚀 Prompt Engineering is a Skill

Like coding or writing, you improve with practice:

- Reframe your queries
- Test different structures
- Review and iterate
- Use tools (e.g., [PromptHero](https://prompthero.com), OpenAI Playground)

## 🙋 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

<details>
<summary>Is prompt engineering only for developers?</summary>

**No.** It's useful for teachers, marketers, analysts, writers — anyone using AI tools!

</details>

<details>
<summary>Do I need to know coding?</summary>

**Not necessarily.** Some advanced prompting can involve code (e.g., using APIs), but basic prompts require only clear language.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How is prompt engineering different from programming?</summary>

Programming is rule-based and deterministic. Prompting is probabilistic — you *influence* output rather than control it.
