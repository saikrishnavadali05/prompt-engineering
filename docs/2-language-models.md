# 2. Understanding Language Models

Language models are at the core of modern Natural Language Processing (NLP). They power tools like chatbots, translators, text summarizers, and more. This document introduces the concept of language models, how they work, and their significance in the field of prompt engineering.

## What is a Language Model?

A language model is a statistical or neural network-based model that predicts the probability of a sequence of words. In simple terms, it tries to guess the next word in a sentence based on the previous words.

For example:  
Given the input, "The sky is", a language model might predict "blue" as the most probable next word.

## Types of Language Models

### 1. Statistical Language Models
These models rely on counting word occurrences and computing probabilities based on them.

- **N-gram Models**: Predict the next word using the last N-1 words.
- Example: Bigram, Trigram models.

### 2. Neural Language Models
Use deep learning to capture complex patterns in language.

- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Capture sequences using memory cells.
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**: Overcome RNN limitations with better memory handling.
- **Transformers**: The backbone of modern models like BERT, GPT.

## Generative vs. Discriminative Models

- **Generative Models** (e.g., GPT): Generate new text.
- **Discriminative Models** (e.g., BERT): Understand or classify existing text.

## How Transformers Work

Transformers are attention-based models. They donâ€™t rely on recurrence but instead use self-attention to weigh the importance of each word in the input.

Example architecture components:
- Multi-head attention
- Positional encodings
- Feed-forward networks

## Key Language Models

- **GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)**: Autoregressive model for generating text.
- **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**: Focuses on understanding context.
- **T5, BART**: Sequence-to-sequence models.

## Applications in Prompt Engineering

- Choosing the right model (GPT-3, Claude, Gemini, etc.)
- Knowing capabilities and limitations (context size, token limit)
- Crafting prompts that match model behavior (e.g., instruct vs. chat mode)

## Summary

Understanding how language models work helps you design better prompts, avoid common mistakes, and build applications that align well with model capabilities.
