# 5. Advanced Prompting Techniques

As you progress in prompt engineering, you’ll encounter more advanced strategies to refine outputs, improve model behavior, and unlock new capabilities. These techniques go beyond basic prompt formats and open doors to deeper model control and creative problem-solving.

## 5.1 Chain-of-Thought Prompting (CoT)

**What it is:** Encourages the model to "think step by step" before giving the final answer.

**Example:**
```

Q: If a train travels at 60 km/h for 2 hours, how far does it travel?
A: Let's think step by step. The formula is distance = speed × time. So, 60 × 2 = 120 km.

```

**Use Case:** Math reasoning, logic problems, multi-step questions.

---

## 5.2 Few-shot Prompting

**What it is:** You provide the model with a few examples of input-output pairs to help it learn the task pattern.

**Example:**
```

Translate English to French:

English: Hello
French: Bonjour

English: Good morning
French: Bonjour

English: How are you?
French:

```

**Use Case:** Custom translation, sentiment labeling, classification.

## 5.3 Self-Consistency Prompting

**What it is:** Instead of relying on a single response, generate multiple outputs and choose the most consistent or frequent one.

**Implementation:** Requires multiple API calls and aggregation of answers.

**Use Case:** High-stakes decision-making, exams, code generation.

---

## 5.4 ReAct (Reason + Act)

**What it is:** Combines reasoning with external tool use or action, particularly useful in agent-based systems.

**Example (simplified):**
```

Question: What's the weather in Paris today?

Thought: I need to check the weather in Paris.
Action: Search\["weather Paris"]
Observation: 18°C and sunny.
Answer: It's 18°C and sunny in Paris.

```

**Use Case:** AI agents, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), planning tasks.

## 5.5 Instruction Tuning Awareness

Instruction-tuned models like ChatGPT or Claude respond more effectively when given clearly phrased instructions.

**Tips:**
- Use directives like “Summarize,” “Classify,” or “Explain like I’m 5.”
- Specify roles: "You are a data scientist..."

---

## 5.6 Prompt Programming

**What it is:** Treating prompt construction like a form of lightweight programming using loops, conditions, templates.

**Tools:**
- LangChain
- PromptLayer
- PromptTemplate classes
