# 7. Prompt Engineering for Specific Domains

Prompt engineering becomes even more powerful when it's **tailored to a specific domain**. Each field‚Äîlike healthcare, finance, legal, education‚Äîhas its own tone, terminology, and goals.

---

### üè• Healthcare

* Use <span style={{ color: 'purple' }}>precise medical terminology</span>.
* Ensure prompts emphasize **accuracy** and **safety**.
* Avoid generating speculative or non-factual content.

**Example:**

```text

### üí∞ Finance

* Focus on <span style={{ color: 'green' }}>data integrity</span>, clarity, and <span style={{ color: 'red' }}>compliance</span>.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Tech & Software

* Use prompts to generate:

**Example:**

```text
Write a Python function that reads a JSON file and prints key-value pairs.
```

### üß† Key Advice

* Know your **audience**.
* Embed **domain knowledge** directly into the prompt.
* Use **controlled language** to prevent hallucinations.
