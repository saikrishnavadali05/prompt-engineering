# 8. Prompt Engineering for Different Models

Not all language models behave the same. Their capabilities, limitations, and syntax expectations can vary based on their **architecture**, **training data**, and **interfaces**. Tailoring prompts to the specific model you're working with improves results dramatically.

---

### ü§ñ GPT Models (OpenAI)

* Extremely versatile and widely adopted.
* Great for **natural conversations**, **code**, **summarization**, etc.
* Use **system prompts** to set context and behavior:

```json
{
  "system": "You are a helpful tutor.",
  "user": "Explain quantum computing in simple terms."
}
```

* Can handle **multi-turn dialogue**, few-shot examples, and long prompts.

---

### üîó Claude (Anthropic)

* More focused on **harmlessness**, **helpfulness**, and **honesty**.
* Sensitive to tone and phrasing‚Äî**politeness helps**.
* Use clear instructions and high-context prompts.

**Example:**

```text
You're a kind assistant. What are some emotional benefits of journaling?
```

---

### ü¶ô LLaMA (Meta)

* Usually requires **more direct** prompting.
* Works better with **few-shot** or **structured** prompts.

**Example:**

```text
Translate the following sentence from English to French: "Good morning!"
```

---

### üê® Koala / Alpaca / Vicuna (Fine-tuned LLaMA variants)

* Often fine-tuned for specific domains or roles.
* May respond better to **instruction-following** formats.

**Example:**

```text
### Instruction:
Summarize the following paragraph in bullet points.
### Input:
<paragraph text>
```

---

### üß™ Command R+ (Cohere) / Mistral / Mixtral / Gemini (Google)

* Each model has unique strengths:

  * **Cohere**: Retrieval-augmented generation.
  * **Mistral**: Lightweight and multilingual.
  * **Gemini**: Tightly integrated with Google ecosystem.

‚úÖ Always refer to **API docs** or playgrounds for best prompt practices!

### üß† Key Differences Across Models

| Feature            | GPT-4       | Claude        | LLaMA       | Gemini       |
| ------------------ | ----------- | ------------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| Multi-turn support | ‚úÖ Yes       | ‚úÖ Yes         | ‚ùå Limited   | ‚úÖ Yes        |
| Few-shot learning  | ‚úÖ Strong    | ‚úÖ Good        | ‚úÖ OK        | ‚úÖ Moderate   |
| Best for           | General use | Safe replies  | Custom apps | Google tools |
| Access             | API + Chat  | API + Console | Local/API   | API/Console  |
